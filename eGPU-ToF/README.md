# Embedded  GPU  based  ToF  image  recognition  for  mobile robots

Created a novel architecture based on PV-CNN that combines  depth  imaging  with  IR.   This  architecture  was  designed particularly for pulse-based Time of Flight (ToF) cameras and the  primary  algorithm’s  target  being  embedded  devices.  Wetested  the  proposed  algorithm  on  custom  indoor/outdoor andpublic datasets,  using  different  camera  vendors.
