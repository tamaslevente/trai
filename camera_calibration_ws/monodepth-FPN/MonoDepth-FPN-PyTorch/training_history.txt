    ~ I will only add things that I changed with respect to the previous training session.
    ~ A "+" means a new configuration added.
    ~ A "-" means a removed configuration.

Training parameters: epochs=15;
Other training parameters:
Others: Multiplying loss with 10
Results: Much faster drop in loss, so... we'll keep this change, but there is still a problem in scaling the image as it is identifying some very distant points
